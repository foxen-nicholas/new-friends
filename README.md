## User Stories
**As a user I want to:**
  - login the app, edit my profile information, and search for new friends
  - search for new friends by category
  - add friends and be able to chat
  - remove any unwanted friends



## Approach
We brainstormed as a group to go over ideas, features, and planning for the app.  We worked remotely and used Trello and HackMD to keep track of workflow.

### Wireframes
We proceeded to create wireframes to get an idea of how the app will look like and function.  Some of the information evolved since the earliest stages of our application such as our models.  However, this gave us a place to start development.
